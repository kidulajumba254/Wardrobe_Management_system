## Troubleshooting

### 1. CORS Issues
If you encounter CORS issues, ensure the `config/cors.php` file in the Laravel backend allows requests from the frontend URL (`http://localhost:5173`).

### 2. Database Connection Issues
Ensure your database credentials in the `.env` file are correct and the MySQL server is running.

### 3. Frontend Not Connecting to Backend
Ensure the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in the frontend `.env` file matches the backend URL (`http://localhost:8000`).

---

## Deployment

### Backend
1. Deploy the Laravel backend to a platform like [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), or any PHP-supported hosting service.
2. Update the `.env` file with production credentials.

### Frontend
1. Build the Vue app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to a platform like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
